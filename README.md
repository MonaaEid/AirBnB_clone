This project is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the system through a command prompt. It provides a set of commands and functionalities that can be used to perform various operations and tasks.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based program that can be executed in a terminal or command prompt. It provides a command-line interface where users can enter commands and receive corresponding outputs or perform actions based on those commands.

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the command interpreter is located.
Run the command interpreter program by executing the appropriate command (e.g., python command_interpreter.py).
How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands and interact with the system. Here are some guidelines on how to use it:

Enter commands: Type commands in the command prompt and press Enter to execute them.
Command syntax: Follow the specified syntax for each command. Make sure to provide the required arguments and options correctly.
Command execution: After entering a command, the command interpreter will process it and perform the corresponding action or display the output.
Command feedback: The command interpreter will provide feedback on the success or failure of command execution, along with any relevant information or error messages.
